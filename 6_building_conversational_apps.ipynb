It\\'s located east of the river not far\\nfrom the Vatican. This is where the Stadium of Domitian was\\nlocated in ancient times and if you view the area from above,\\nyou can still imagine the circular form of the arena. The\\n\\nthe spring with a dowsing rod and Agrippa ordering the construction of the aqueduct. \\nTwo other large statues tell of the benefits of\\nthis water: good health (the snake, still symbolic of pharmacies, was associated with Asclepius, the god of medicine), and the\\narrival of material goods (the cornucopia). Finally, Neptune is center-stage under a grand triumphal arch. The titan of the ocean\\nbrings to mind both Bernini and Michelangelo. On either side, winged sea horses dart furiously at onlookers. \\nIt\\'s truly impressive.\\nYou\\'ll want to sit and stay for a while, transfixed by the fountain’s beauty. \\nRoberto Gonzalez:\\n At first glance, it seems as if the fountain was built right in the very center of the city, but the reality is\\nactually the opposite. All of the surrounding houses and palaces were intentionally built there to so that inhabitants could enjoy\\nthe fountain’s charms. \\nAnd the fountain sure does have its charms. This fountain, which took 30 long years to build, collects a\\nstaggering 2,000 Euros a week from well-wishers, a sum which is collected by the city of Rome and directed toward the upkeep of\\nthe city’s fountains. \\nThere are dozens of complex allegories at the heart of the fountain but my favorites are the horses which\\nreflect the states of the sea (raging, calm, stormy, etc.). \\nOne tip: be careful with pickpockets…they swarm around this famous\\nfountain. \\nSimona Budà:\\n\\nabout 135m. wide and 81m. tall (including the chariots that\\nadorn the towers on both sides). \\nWhen you climb the steps,\\nthere’s a great equestrian statue of the King. To the right,\\nthere is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of WWI with an\\neternal flame and two soldiers standing permanent guard It\\nalso offers exception views of Rome, a fact which makes the\\ntiring climb worthwhile. Although the monument was very\\ncontroversial in its day and has received all kinds of\\nhumorous and derogatory nicknames over the years (the\\nAllies famously called it the \"typewriter\" when they entered\\nRome in 1944), it is still one of the most-visited monuments in\\nthe city after the Vatican and the Roman Ruins. \\nThe base\\n☎\\n 39 066 780 664\\n - \\nPiazza Venezia, \\nRome\\n12\\nSquares\\nPiazza del Popolo\\n \\nTrotamundos:\\n \\nThe Piazza del Popolo is one of the most\\nfamous squares in Rome and its name means \"the People\\'s\\nSquare.\" It’s located at the north gate of the Aurelian walls\\nwhere the Porta Flaminia once marked the beginning of the\\nVia Flaminia, the main northern road during Imperial times.\\nThe square currently has a neoclassical look thanks to\\narchitect Giusseppe Valadier who redesigned it from 1811-\\n1822. If you look at the square from the north, there are three\\nmain streets which sprout from the square in trident shape:\\nVia del Corso in the center, Via del Babuino on the left, and\\nthe Via di Ripetta to the right. The twin churches of Santa\\nMaría dei Miracoli (1681) and Santa Maria in Montesanto\\n\\nreflect the states of the sea (raging, calm, stormy, etc.). \\nOne tip: be careful with pickpockets…they swarm around this famous\\nfountain. \\nSimona Budà:\\n If there’s the first time here, you must throw a coin in the fountain and while you’re throwing the coin, you have\\nto make a wish. It’s a crowded destination, but it’s worth it!\\nAmy Pickard :\\n Absolutely beautiful attraction. Went back for a second visit before we left. Only downside was the huge\\namount of people around the attraction so was hard to get around. \\nJoshua B.:\\n Trevi fountain was amazing.

It\\'s located on a road between Caelian Hill and\\nPalatine Hill where they once celebrated victory marches. It\\'s\\n21 meters high, 26 meters wide, and more than 7 meters\\nthick. It was built in 315AD to celebrate the 10th anniversary\\nof the reign of Constantine and his victory over Maxentius at\\nthe Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312AD.
